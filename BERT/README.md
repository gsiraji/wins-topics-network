## Model Workflow

1. Preprocess_Data.ipynb
   Clean titles of abstracts of the articles by removing stopwords, using bigram and lemmatization. It saves the preprocessed data into preprocessed_data.json.
2. Preprocess_Split_Time.ipynb
   Prepare data to be later fed into BERTopic for topic modeling. Full datasets are splitted into 3 equal-length time periods.
3. BERTopic_Full.ipynb
   Run BERTopic for data on the full range of time. Models are saved by the end.
4. BERTopic_Splitted_Time.ipynb
   Run BERTopic separately for data splitted in 3 periods. Models are saved by the end.
5. BERTopic_Results.ipynb
   Visualize results and save to html. Calculate and save graph data representing the relations between topics according to the co-occurences of subject labels provided on arXiv for each article.
6. Topic_Graph_by_Categories.ipynb
   Plot the relationship graph of topics that is generated by subject labels using igraph.
